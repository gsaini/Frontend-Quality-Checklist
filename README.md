# Frontend-Quality-Checklist

[Top Webpack plugins for faster development](https://codeburst.io/top-webpack-plugins-for-faster-development-a2f6accb7a3e)


What do you think about when you think about code quality?
As Robert C. Martin said “A long descriptive name is better than a short enigmatic name. A long descriptive name is better than a long descriptive comment.”  and “Clean code is not written by following a set of rules. You don’t become a software craftsman by learning a list of heuristics. Professionalism and craftsmanship come from values that drive disciplines.” 
This quarter we will focus on Clean Code and Clean Architecture so that you can hone your skills of craftmanship in order to release a clean human readable code.

# Announcement:
Everybody is talking about Future Stack ( not Full stack) hence we are quite excitied to annouce that we are integrating Backend and Frontend streams as a one and will publish learnings and trainings under our Future Stack "Espresso" stream.
